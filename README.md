## Description
When you open the Note Taker App, you are presented with a landing page with a button to a notes page. When you click on the notes page, then you are presented with existing notes listed on the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new notes title and notes text in the right-hand column. When you enter a new note title and text you can then press the save button that appears in the navigation at the top of the page. When you click the save icon, the note that was entered will be saved in the left-hand column. When you press on the listed existing notes, the note is then presented in the right-hand column. When you press the write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, you will be presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the text in the right-hand column.
